**This is the official implementation of Causal-DFQ: Causality Guided Data-free Network Quantization (Yuzhang Shang, Bingxin Xu, Gaowen Liu, Ramana Kompella, and Yan Yan), which has been accepted to ICCV 2023.**     
**code will be released soon.**

Causal-DFQ will be integrated into Cicso Network Compression Toolbox ([Official Blog](https://techblog.cisco.com/blog/unleashing-the-power-of-causality-introducing-causal-reasoning-to-data-free-model-quantization)). It is happy to see my research can be used by industry.
